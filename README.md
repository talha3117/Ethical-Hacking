## ‚úÖ How to use this repo

1. Browse folders and download PDFs you need.
2. Study theory first, then practice in **isolated lab environments** (VMs, intentionally vulnerable lab targets, CTFs).
3. Follow the Documentation templates when creating reports or writing findings.
4. Keep your own notes in `/notes` or fork the repo and create a `/my-labs` folder for practical exercises.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safe & legal usage guidelines

* Always get **written permission** before testing any network or system you don‚Äôt own.
* Use local VMs, lab networks, or approved CTF platforms for practice.
* Follow your organization‚Äôs security policy and responsible disclosure procedures if you discover vulnerabilities.
* Do not upload or store sensitive personal data or credentials in this repo.
